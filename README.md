WinDI - A Wind tunnel Design Instrument
=======================================

Keywords: pressure loss coefficient, pressure loss, optimize, ducts, wind tunnel, tue, diffuser, contraction, exit, inlet, corners, test section.

WinDI is build as a tool to calculate and optimize the pressure loss in 
a wind tunnel or other duct system (e.g. ventilation ducts). It's aim 
was to support the wind tunnel design process. WinDI is written in 
Matlab. It is currently not compatible with GNU Octave.

WinDI is written by Rinka van Dommelen and Patrick Hanckmann as tool to 
support the research performed for the thesis submitted in partial 
fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science of 
Building Physics and Services at the Department of Built Environment of 
the Eindhoven University of Technology from Rinka van Dommelen. The thesis
is provided at http://www.rinkavandommelen.nl/WindtunnelThesisRinka.pdf.
